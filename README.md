# 🔎 Graph Traversal using BFS and DFS (Django + Python)
# 📌 Project Overview

This project implements Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) using Python.

The project is developed using Django framework.

Users can input graph data and select traversal method.

The system displays traversal order based on selected algorithm.

It helps in understanding graph traversal concepts practically.

# 🎯 Objectives

To understand graph traversal techniques.

To implement BFS using Queue.

To implement DFS using Recursion or Stack.

To integrate algorithms with Django web interface.

To display traversal results dynamically on webpage.

# 🔹 Breadth First Search (BFS)

Traverses the graph level by level.

Uses Queue (FIFO).

Visits all adjacent nodes first.

Useful for shortest path in unweighted graph.

Time Complexity: O(V + E).

Space Complexity: O(V).

# 🔹 Depth First Search (DFS)

Traverses the graph depth wise.

Uses Stack or Recursion.

Goes deep into one branch before backtracking.

Useful for cycle detection and path finding.

Time Complexity: O(V + E).

Space Complexity: O(V).

# ⚙️ Features

User inputs number of vertices.

User inputs graph edges.

User selects BFS or DFS.

Displays traversal order clearly.

Django-based web interface.

Simple and user-friendly UI.

# ▶️ Working Process

User opens web application.

Enters graph details.

Selects starting node.

Chooses BFS or DFS.

Django processes input using Python logic.

Traversal result is displayed on webpage.
